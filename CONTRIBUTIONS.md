## âœ… Contribution Guidelines

- Keep commits atomic and meaningful
- Follow the existing **Atomic Design** component structure
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Don't forget to run `npm run format` if you've made code changes
- Add meaningful **comments** when implementing logic that's not obvious
- Cover new features or logic with tests (unit or component)

## ðŸ§ª Local Testing

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit testing.  
Run all tests locally with:

```bash
npx vitest
```

## ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

- Use context when shared state is needed across features
- Prefer small, stateless components when possible
- Persist data in the browser using versioned localStorage for durability and flexibility
- Favor composability and readability over cleverness
